Where I hold my C++ projects, big and small


### difference_between
Input two numbers as prompted, and the program will output the difference between the two numbers.
Ways to improve: add command line arguments

### volume
A program used to help optimize the length of a box to get a desired volume. Works best if you know the width and height, since the program natively locks those and uses the length as the manipulated variable.
